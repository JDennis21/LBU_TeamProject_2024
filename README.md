Aims to develop an IoT solution using Raspberry Pi technology to keep track of indoor climate conditions. The system integrates temperature and air quality sensors with a fan and LED, controlled via a web interface. Data is recorded in a database and displayed on the website, allowing users to remotely monitor and adjust fan settings for optimal comfort and air quality.
